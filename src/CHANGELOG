2011-12-4
  * fixed bug where summary function did not print updated taxon and partition information after exclusion
2011-12-4
  * added check for overwriting tree output files
2011-12-2
  * made transition to xcode project
  * added check for taxa with completely missing data
2011-11-21
  * fixed some compilation issues for linux
2011-11-20
  * fixed omission of translation table from annotated tree file
  * user has option to overwrite default tree file name (Decisivator.tree) or rename
2011-11-19
  * can annotate:
	- simple cladograms
	- phylograms
	- cladograms with annotations (perhaps trees having undergone previous Decisivator analyses)
	- phylograms with annotations (e.g. BEAST-style)
  * released code for peer review
2011-11-18
  * can annotate MrBayes trees (i.e. with edge lengths)
2011-11-17
  * fixed missing argument in branch-wise partial decisiveness
  * bipartition table now logged to disk (as well as screen)
2011-11-16
  * fixed bug in translating from tree -> translation table -> alignment
  * results from user-tree analysis displayed in a bipartition table
2011-11-15
  * fixed bug in indexing reference taxa where last taxon is NOT a reference taxon
2011-11-14
  * fixed bug in mapping translation table to alignment
2011-11-13
  * starting drafting a rough user manual
2011-11-11
  * split partial decisiveness into tree-wise and branch-wise
2011-11-8
  * can calculate number and proportion of ways a particular user-edge is satisfied
2011-11-5
  * can handle rooted or unrooted (or combination thereof) trees
2011-11-4
  * can burnin and thin trees passed in
2011-10-27
  * can read in translation tables (in case it differs from alignment ordering)
2011-10-25
  * can read in multiple user trees. still no translation tables (yet)
2011-10-24
  * can read in user-tree. no translation table (at the moment)
2011-10-18
  * can export reduced matrix in Nexus or PHYLIP formats
2011-10-18
  * added further exclusion criteria:
	- overlap criterion (either worst or threshold overlap)
	- taxa with sequences for ONLY gene X (per Tank request)
  * better summary information printed to screen
2011-09-25
  * made taxon exclusion more general
	- by index
	- by name
	- missing N partitions
	- missing >= N partitions
2011-09-13
  * no longer logs all missing quartets: exhausts memory on large data sets (e.g. >15000 taxa)
	- instead logs a single (int) vector of taxa, counting when taxon i is missing from a quartet
  * no longer immediately tests for decisiveness; user may want to make changes first
2011-08-31
  * made more general; can handle any kind of data (i.e. not just nucleotides)
  * fixed one-off bug in character counting
	- only really a problem with single-character (e.g. morphological) data
