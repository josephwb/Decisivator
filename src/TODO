1. read in user tree(s)
   1. single tree - DONE!
   2. allow multiple trees - DONE!
   3. allow translation table - DONE!
   4. rearrange user tree(s) to reflect alignment ordering (or just map) - DONE!
   5. exclude taxa from a user tree, and ability to export (low priority)
   6. allow burnin + thinning - DONE!
   7. allow rooted and unrooted trees - DONE!
2. calculate number of satisfied quartets per edge on a given tree - DONE!
   1. will be a proportion, as interior edges have more potential quartets- DONE!
       - give this value a name ('foo' for the moment; look in Sanderson/Steel papers)
   2. print tree labelled with foo in FigTree style - DONE!
	- no edge lengths - DONE!
	- no edge lengths, with annotation (do these trees even exist?) - DONE!
	- with edge lengths - DONE!
	- with edge lengths and existing annotations (i.e. BEAST-style) - DONE!
3. make parallel ***
	- works with mattix decisiveness, but not implemented for a user-tree
4. make for general data (not just nucleotides) - DONE!
5. exclude taxa: - DONE!
   1. by index - DONE!
   2. missing N genes - DONE!
   3. missing <= N genes - DONE!
   4. by name - DONE!
   5. possessing N genes - DONE!
   6. possessing N or fewer genes - DONE!
   7. possessing data for only a specific gene - DONE!
6. export nexus file for reduced matrix - DONE!
7. print log so can be run in background - IMPLEMENTED FOR USER TREES, BUT NOTHING ELSE (YET)
8. automatically report version/month/year - DONE!
9. write rudimentary manual - STARTED
10. make formatting less Draconian (low priority until informed otherwise)
   1. CHARSETs - allow referential CHARSETS, multiple ranges, etc.
   2. allow more flexibility in attributes definitions - DONE!
11. switch to APE tree-formatting - STARTED
12. print out locus-specific coverage - DONE!
13. print out taxon-specific coverage - DONE!
14. give better options for deleting partitions - DONE!
15. implement genetic algorithm (via Daniel) - DONE!
   1. add N genes - DONE!
   2. add until decisive
   3. delete taxa until decisive
   4. print out augmented matrix to file - DONE!
   5. need to tweak GA parameters: population size, tournament size, mutation
   6. have irregular hill-climbing steps (code there, just not used/optimized)
16. allow input of phylip-formatted data (and separate partition file) e.g. ala RAxML
17. allow user to specify that all characters are independent (e.g. morphological) instead of providing a huge number of CHARSET declarations
18. check whether partitions contain constant data
19. use getopt for parsing commandline arguments
20. more efficient handling of CHARSETs ala pxboot
21. user-tree analysis: currently checks all relevant gene-quartets. add option to count number of genes which speak to an edge (not # quartets). considerably less computation.


Fix:
1. tree-wise and branch-wise partial decisiveness is currently the same thing.
2. where possible, initialize vectors instead of using push. should enable better multithreading indexing
3. getSibNodes is a huge bottleneck.
4. only seems to accept Nexus user trees. add newick.


Enhancements
1. recode all with 1) bit strings and 2) set operations. this is a complete re-write.
2. use autoconf and configure
3. add option that only variable data are considered (involves creating internal matrix representation).
4. add constraint tree option. considering all possible trees is silly. when simulating 'random' trees, make sure they are compatible with the constraint tree. should give much more informative results.
