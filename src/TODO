1. read in user tree(s)
   1. single tree - DONE
   2. allow multiple trees - DONE!
   3. allow translation table - DONE!
   4. rearrange user tree(s) to reflect alignment ordering (or just map) - DONE!
   5. exclude taxa from a user tree, and ability to export (low priority)
   6. allow burnin + thinning - DONE!
   7. allow rooted and unrooted trees - DONE!
2. calculate number of satisfied quartets per edge on a given tree - DONE!
   1. will be a proportion, as interior edges have more potential quartets- DONE!
       - give this value a name ('foo' for the moment; look in Sanderson/Steel papers)
   2. print tree labelled with foo in FigTree style - DONE!
	- no edge lengths - DONE!
	- no edge lengths, with annotation (do these trees even exist?) - DONE!
	- with edge lengths - DONE!
	- with edge lengths and existing annotations (i.e. BEAST-style) - DONE!
3. make parallel ***
4. make for general data (not just nucleotides) - DONE!
5. exclude taxa:
   1. by index - DONE!
   2. missing N genes - DONE!
   3. missing <= N genes - DONE!
   4. by name - DONE!
   5. possessing N genes - DONE!
   6. possessing N or fewer genes - DONE!
   7. possessing data for only a specific gene - DONE!
6. export nexus file for reduced matrix - DONE!
7. print log so can be run in background - IMPLEMENTED FOR USER TREES, BUT NOTHING ELSE (YET)
8. automatically report version/month/year - DONE!
9. write rudimentary manual - STARTED
10. make CHARSET formatting less Draconian (low priority until informed otherwise)
11. switch to APE tree-formatting
12. print out locus-specific coverage - DONE!
13. print out taxon-specific coverage - DONE!
14. give better options for deleting partitions
